          <p class="bio">I'm Robin. I do research in Human-Computer Interaction at the intersection of social computing and accessibility. I ask how we can best represent disability and older age in systems. I design, build, and study systems to better support technology use (and non-use) by older adults and people with vision impairments. Most recently, I have investigated the role of accessible voice communities through voice assistants and Interactive Voice Response tools and how these technologies support or do not support social and informational needs. My research team of postdocs and students are also working on projects related to obfuscation and AI visual access, care platforms and labor, memory and digitization, and mitigating information uncertainty in conversational technologies.</p>

          <p class="bio"> I am an Assistant Professor at University of Michigan's School of Information (<a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">UMSI</a>).  In 2021, I co-founded the <a href="https://aha.si.umich.edu/">Accessibility, HCI, and Aging (AHA!)</a> lab across the School of Information, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and STAMPS School of Art & Design. I also hold affiliate positions in the <a href="https://esc.umich.edu/">Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing (ESC)</a>, the <a href="https://www.digitalstudies.umich.edu/">Digital Studies Institute (DSI)</a>, the <a href="https://micda.isr.umich.edu/">Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging (MiCDA)</a>, and the <a href="https://ihpi.umich.edu/">Insititute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation (IHPI)</a>. My research has been funded by the NSF, Google, NIH, and the Retirement Research Foundation. I have also worked at Google as a visiting researcher and Microsoft Research, Facebook, and IBM Research as a user experience researcher.</p>
          <p class="bio">I was awarded a President's Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of Michigan and hold a Ph.D. in Technology and Social Behavior from Northwestern University, M.S. in Human-Centered Computing from UMBC, and B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.</p>
