          <p class="bio">I'm Robin. I do research in Human-Computer Interaction at the intersection of social computing and accessibility. I ask how experiences with technology can be made more accessible to digitally constrained communities. Specifically, I design, build, and study systems to better engage older adults and people with vision impairments who face barriers to accessing and engaging with technology. I also study how people in these communities are actively engaging digitally and how researchers and designers can learn from their strengths. Most recently, I have investigated the role of accessible voice interfaces (e.g. IVR and smart speakers) and the ways in which these technologies support or do not support social and informational needs. My students are also working on projects related to obfuscation and AI technologies, emerging and accessible work practices, care platforms and labor, and memory and digitization.</p>
          <p class="bio"> I am an Assistant Professor at University of Michigan's School of Information (<a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">UMSI</a>).  In 2021, I co-founded the <a href="https://aha.si.umich.edu/">Accessibility, HCI, and Aging (AHA!)</a> lab across the School of Information, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and STAMPS School of Art & Design. I also hold affiliate positions in the <a href="https://esc.umich.edu/">Center for Ethics, Society, and Computing (ESC)</a> and the <a href="https://www.digitalstudies.umich.edu/">Digital Studies Institute</a>. My research has been funded by the NSF, Google, the Retirement Research Foundation, and the Department of Transportation. In the past I have conducted research at Northwestern University, University of Maryland - Baltimore County (UMBC), Carnegie Mellon University, and University of Maryland - College Park. I have also worked at Microsoft Research, Facebook, and IBM Research as a user experience researcher.</p>
          <p class="bio">I hold a Ph.D. in Technology and Social Behavior from Northwestern University, M.S. in Human-Centered Computing from UMBC, and B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland.</p>
