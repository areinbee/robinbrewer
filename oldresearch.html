	        	<p>
            I am researching ways to developing meaningful and accessibile technologies that help aging populations and people with vision impairments engage in online communities and with resources in new ways. Read below for a list of active research projects.
            </p>


            <h2>Transportation as a Resource</h2>
            <p>Transportation is key for social and economic mobility, but can be challenging for people with disabilities such as vision loss or mobility challenges to access. I am interested in understanding how emerging forms of transportation (i.e. autonomous vehicles and ridesharing) can be more accessible to communities. Currently, I am looking for someone who wants to build technology to make these modes of transportation accessible to blind and low vision people. Relevant papers:
              <ul>
                <li>Understanding Trust, Transportation, and Accessibility through Ridesharing. CHI 2019.</li>
                <li>Understanding the Power of Control in Autonomous Vehicles for People with Vision Impairments. ASSETS 2018.</li>
                <li>'We can go anywhere': Understanding Independence through a Case Study of Ride-hailing Use by People with Visual Impairments in metropolitan India. CSCW 2018.</li>
                <li>Facilitating discussion and shared meaning: Rethinking co-design sessions with people with vision impairments. PervasiveHealth 2018 (short paper).</li>
              </ul>
            </p>


            <h2>Online Engagement + New Forms of Social Support</h2>
            <p>Some people cannot easily access computers, smartphones, and traditional forms of internet access everyday, and others may not want to.  Yet, internet access does provide resources like social support and can affect emotional well-being. This is particularly important for aging populations who are at higher risk for isolation and depression. My prior work has investigated how older adults currently engage online to inform how to better engage those who do not participate. Rather than force people to use computers and smartphones, I study how we can use technologies people are familiar with and interested in using by mostly studying how landline phones and smart speakers can be leveraged as a source of social support. I am looking for someone primarily interested in conducting qualitative research, with some survey development and analysis skills to understand social support and older adults. Relevant papers:
              <ul>
                <li>xPress: Rethinking Design for Aging and Accessibility through a Voice-Based Online Blogging Community. CSCW 2017.</li>
                <li>Subcontracting Microwork. CHI 2017.</li>
                <li>"Tell It Like It Really Is": A Case of Online Content Creation and Sharing Among Older Adult Bloggers. CHI 2016.</li>
                <li>"Why would anybody do this?": Understanding Older Adultsâ€™ Motivations and Challenges in Crowd Work. CHI 2016.</li>
                <li>Exploring Traditional Phones as an E-Mail Interface for Older Adults. TACCESS 2016.</li>
                <li>An Approach to Audio-Only Editing for Visually Impaired Seniors. ASSETS 2016. </li>
                <li>Exploring Cognitive Benefits as an Alternative Motivation for Engaging Older Adults in Crowdwork. HCOMP 2015.</li>
                <li>Pinteresce: Exploring Reminiscence as an Incentive to Digital Reciprocity for Older Adults. CSCW 2014. </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Accessible Information Seeking</h2>
            <p>Voice interfaces can also be used as a more accessible means for information seeking and retrieval, particularly for people with late-life loss or those who face additional challenges navigating with and using a smartphone or computer. Yet, information access also helps people access resources that can sustain and improve well-being. I study how we can use voice interfaces as a means to help older adults and people with disabilities access information online. I am looking for someone interested in analyzing small to large datasets of voice-based queries.</p>

            <h2>Trust and Voice Interfaces</h2>
            <p>While voice interfaces can make some things easy, they are not perfect. Notably, they lack cues that are present with multi-modal or graphical interfaces. Yet, some people have to rely on voice interfaces. I am studying how digitally constrained communities navigate and negotiate trust with voice-based interfaces.</p>

	        	<h1>Want to Do Research?</h1>
	        	<h2>Ph.D.</h2>
	        	<p>I am seeking to admit a Ph.D. student starting Fall 2020 interested in accessibility and social computing. Preferred skills include proficiency in at least one programming language (e.g. Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.) and excellent written communication skills. If interested, apply to the <a href="#">Ph.D. program in Information</a> by XXX and list my name as a faculty member with whom you would be interested in doing research.</p>

	        	<h2>Master's or Undergraduate</h2>
	        	<p>I love working with students! However, I want to ensure the experience is mutually rewarding. I mostly develop systems and conduct qualitative research to evaluate accessibile systems or study existing use of technology/online communities.If interested in pursuing a research opportunity with my research group,  (1) read through the active research projects on this page, (2) read at least one of my authored papers on a topic that interests you, (3) decide what type of research interests you most and complete one of the starter projects below. </p>

	        	<p>If you are interested in pursuing qualitative research, write two paragraphs extending one of my existing areas of research. These paragraphs should clearly state the way(s) in which you wish to extend this work, why, and describe 1-2 methods you would use to do so. Preferably, the "why" should be based on some existing body of work, whether this be an existing research study or a recent news article. Once done, please submit via email and we can set up time to talk.</p>

	        	<p>If you are interested in building something, you do not need to have a computer science degree. Instead, I want to know that you are willing and can quickly learn something new. Currently, my research focuses on accessible voice-based interfaces. As such, use online tools ike Twilio, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure to prototype a basic voice interface that could be useful for older adults or people with disabilities. This system (i.e. IVR prototype, smart assistant skill) does not need to be complex, and could be extending an existing tutorial in a unique way. When done, send instructions on how I could listen and we can set up time to talk.</p>
