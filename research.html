            <p>I am studying, designing, and developing accessibile technologies that help aging populations and people with vision impairments engage in online communities and with resources in meaningful ways. Read below for a list of active research projects.</p>

            <h2>Accessible Information Seeking</h2>
            <p>Voice interfaces can also be used as a more accessible means for information seeking and retrieval, particularly for people with late-life loss or those who face challenges navigating and using a smartphone or computer. Yet, forms of information seeking helps people access critical resources that can sustain and improve well-being. I study how we can leverage voice interfaces as a tool to facilitate easier information access.</p>
            
            <p class="nowhiring">Hiring: I am looking for a students who are interested in 1) analyzing small to large datasets of voice-based queries and 2) developing new interaction techniques for digital assistants.</p>


            <h2>Transportation as a Resource</h2>
            <p>Transportation is key for social and economic mobility, but can be challenging for people with disabilities such as vision loss or mobility challenges to access. I am interested in understanding how emerging forms of transportation (i.e. autonomous vehicles and ridesharing) can be more accessible to communities. Relevant papers:
              <ul>
                <li>Understanding Trust, Transportation, and Accessibility through Ridesharing. CHI 2019.</li>
                <li>Understanding the Power of Control in Autonomous Vehicles for People with Vision Impairments. ASSETS 2018.</li>

              </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="nowhiring">Hiring: I am looking for students who want to design and build technology to make these modes of transportation accessible to blind and low vision people.</p>


            <h2>Online Engagement + New Forms of Social Support</h2>
            <p>Some people cannot easily access computers, smartphones, and traditional forms of internet access everyday, and others may not want to.  Yet, internet access does provide resources like social support and can affect emotional well-being. This is particularly important for aging populations who are at higher risk for isolation and depression. My prior work has investigated how older adults currently engage online to inform how to better engage those who do not participate. Rather than force people to use computers and smartphones, I study how we can use technologies people are familiar with and interested in using by mostly studying how landline phones and smart speakers can be leveraged as a source of social support.

            </p>

            <p class="nowhiring">Hiring: I am looking for someone primarily interested in conducting qualitative research, with some survey development and analysis skills to understand social support and older adults.</p>
