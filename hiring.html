          <h1>Want to Do Research?</h1>
	        	<h2>Ph.D.</h2>
	        	<p>I am seeking to admit at least one Ph.D. student starting Fall 2020 interested in accessibility and social computing. Preferred skills include proficiency in at least one programming language (e.g. Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.) and excellent written communication skills. If interested, apply to the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/phd-information/admissions">Ph.D. program in Information</a> by December 1, 2019 and list my name as a faculty member with whom you would be interested in doing research.</p>

	        	<h2>Master's or Undergraduate</h2>
	        	<p>I love working with students! However, I want to ensure the experience is mutually rewarding. I mostly develop systems and conduct qualitative research to evaluate accessibile systems or study existing use of technology/online communities. If interested in pursuing an unsolicited research opportunity with my research group, (1) read through the active research projects on my <a href="research.html">research page</a>, (2) read at least one of my authored papers on a topic that interests you, (3) decide what type of research interests you most and complete one of the starter projects below. </p>

	        	<p>If you are interested in pursuing qualitative research, write two paragraphs extending one of my existing areas of research. These paragraphs should clearly state the way(s) in which you wish to extend this work, why, and describe 1-2 methods you would use to do so. Preferably, the "why" should be based on some existing body of work, whether this be an existing research study or a recent news article. Once done, please submit via email and we can set up time to talk.</p>

	        	<p>If you are interested in building something, you do not need to have a computer science degree. Instead, I want to know that you are willing and can quickly learn something new. Currently, my research focuses on accessible voice-based interfaces. As such, use online tools ike Twilio, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure to prototype a basic voice interface that could be useful for older adults or people with disabilities. This system (i.e. IVR prototype, smart assistant skill) does not need to be complex, and could be extending an existing tutorial in a unique way. When done, send instructions on how I could listen and we can set up time to talk.</p>
